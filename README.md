## A Real-time Stock Exchange Simulator

This is the codebase of a real-time stock exchange simulator, developed in 2009 for an online competition called **Dalal Bull** which was part of [**Excel**](https://excelmec.ord/), a National Level Technical Symposium organized by [**Govt. Model Engineering College**](http://www.mec.ac.in/) while I was doing my Bachelors there. 

Dalal Bull is an online stock trading competition. Each participant will be provided with a fixed amount as initial virtual capital. This amount can be used to buy shares of different firms. The firms are from NIFTY50 (India) and actual market fluctuations decides the share price. 

As of 2017, the competition still continues to be one of the popular events of the technical symposium which is held annually.
